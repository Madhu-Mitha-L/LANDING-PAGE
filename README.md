# LANDING-PAGE

## Overview

The Landing Page is a stylish and functional web page designed to offer a sleek introduction to various web design concepts. It features a toggle button to switch between light and dark modes, enhancing the user experience by providing a customizable view.

## Objectives

- **Interactive Toggle Button**: Provides a seamless way for users to switch between light and dark themes, enhancing user comfort and accessibility.
- **Modern Design**: Incorporates contemporary design principles for a clean and engaging interface that appeals to users.
- **Responsive Layout**: Ensures that the landing page adjusts gracefully to various screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience across devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structures the content of the landing page, including the navigation bar, content sections, and toggle button.
- **CSS**: Styles the landing page with a modern design, including light and dark mode themes. It handles layout, colors, and transitions.
- **JavaScript**: Manages the functionality of the toggle button, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes dynamically.

## How It Works

- **User Interaction**: Users click the toggle button to switch between light and dark modes.
- **CSS Styling**: CSS variables define color schemes for light and dark modes. JavaScript updates these variables based on user interactions.
